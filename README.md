##Description:An interactive quiz application is a dynamic platform designed to engage users with a series of questions across various formats—like multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, and more—while offering immediate feedback and scoring. Here's what typically defines such an app:
- User Engagement: Users can participate in quizzes tailored to topics of interest or educational goals, often with timers or gamified elements to keep the experience lively.
- Customization: Admins or educators can create and manage quiz content, including adding images, videos, or audio clips for a richer experience.
- Progress Tracking: Users can view scores, track progress over time, and sometimes earn badges or level up based on performance.
  It’s widely used in classrooms, training environments, and even for fun trivia games. If you're thinking of building one or need a concept tailored for a specific purpose—say, language learning, corporate training, or pop culture
